// `tests/common/mod.rs` is compiled into every integration-test binary
// that does `mod common;`, but each binary only uses a subset of the
// helpers — Rust's dead-code analysis runs per-binary and can't see
// the cross-binary usage. Suppress here so a helper that's used in
// only one test file doesn't fire a warning in the other.
#![allow(dead_code)]

//! Shared test helpers for the proxy integration tests.
//!
//! The big-ticket item here is [`AuditCapture`], a process-wide
//! tracing subscriber that records every `target = "scg::audit"`
//! event into an in-memory buffer. Tests use it to assert that the
//! audit pipeline emits what it should.
//!
//! ## Why a global subscriber, not `set_default`?
//!
//! Earlier versions installed a per-test capture via
//! `tracing::subscriber::set_default(...)`, which scopes the
//! subscriber to the current thread. That works when the test's
//! tokio runtime happens to keep every task on the current thread,
//! but the gRPC server is `tokio::spawn`'d onto a worker pool and
//! its audit events frequently fire on a different thread — which
//! the per-thread subscriber doesn't see. The result was a flaky
//! test that passed in isolation and failed under workspace
//! parallelism.
//!
//! `tracing::subscriber::set_global_default` is process-wide, so it
//! sees every thread, but it can only be called once. We wrap it in
//! a `OnceLock` and serialize the tests that use it with a mutex —
//! integration tests that need audit capture all hold the same
//! `AuditCapture::lease`, so they run one-at-a-time within their
//! file (and across files, since the global state is shared).
