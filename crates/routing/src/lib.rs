//! Routing core: SessionKey, Pool trait, AffinityStore trait,
//! TenantRouter, and Router.
//!
//! Backend selection is broken into pieces so each can evolve
//! independently:
//!
//! * `Pool` — *which* backend should serve a fresh session?
//! * `AffinityStore` — *which* backend already serves an existing session?
//! * `TenantRouter` — map a tenant string to its pool. Single-tenant
//!   deployments still work — they configure exactly one entry
//!   (often the implicit `"default"`).
//! * `Router` — glue that asks the store first, then the pool from
//!   `TenantRouter`, and remembers the decision.
