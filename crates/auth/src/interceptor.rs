//! Tonic interceptor that runs an `Authenticator` and stamps the
//! verified `Identity` onto the request's extensions.
//!
//! Note on async vs sync interceptors:
//!
//! Tonic's built-in `Interceptor` trait is *sync*. Some authenticators
//! (notably OIDC with JWKS rotation) need to await network I/O, which
//! a sync interceptor can't do. We therefore expose this interceptor
//! via a free function that the proxy calls explicitly at the head of
//! every RPC handler — see `crates/proxy` for the call site.
//!
//! That keeps the framework boundary clean: the proxy is responsible
//! for reading the inbound metadata, calling `authenticate`, attaching
//! the resulting identity, and *then* dispatching to the per-RPC
//! method body. The Spark Connect service surface is small enough
//! (under twenty RPCs) that calling `authenticate` per handler is
//! manageable; a tower-layer-based async interceptor would be a
//! future refactor.
