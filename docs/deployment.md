# Deployment guide

This guide takes you from "I have a Kubernetes cluster" to "PySpark
clients are landing on the right Spark Connect drivers and staying
there across gateway-pod restarts." It is written for the operator
who will own the deployment day-2 — the README explains *what* the
gateway is; this doc explains *how to run it well*.

## Prerequisites

| | Required | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes | ≥ 1.24 | Chart uses `discovery.k8s.io/v1` EndpointSlices (GA in 1.21) and probe HTTP/2 fields stabilized in 1.24 |
| Helm | ≥ 4.0 | Chart uses Helm 4 schema. Earlier Helm versions will refuse to install. |
| Spark Connect servers | ≥ 1 reachable from the gateway pods | The gateway is a stateless proxy; it needs *something* to forward to |
| Redis | Optional but **strongly recommended** for HA | Multi-replica gateway needs shared affinity state — see [Redis decision](#picking-the-redis-backing) |

The gateway itself does not need any cluster-scoped permissions. The
only RBAC it ever needs is namespace-scoped read on `endpoints` /
`endpointslices`, and only when `backendDiscovery.type=k8s`. The
chart attaches that automatically.

## Day 0: a minimal install

Pick a namespace and use the chart defaults:

```bash
helm install scg ./deploy/helm/scg \
  --namespace spark-connect --create-namespace
```

Defaults give you:

* 2 gateway replicas (the smallest meaningful HA configuration)
* 1 bundled Redis StatefulSet with AOF persistence + 1Gi PVC
* A static backend list pointing at
  `spark-connect-1.svc.cluster.local:15002` and
  `spark-connect-2.svc.cluster.local:15002`
* No authentication (every caller is `user_id="anonymous"`)
* No OTel tracing (structured JSON logs only)

This is **enough for a smoke test on a trusted in-cluster network**.
It is *not* a production configuration; see the rest of this guide
for how to harden it.

Verify the install:

```bash
kubectl -n spark-connect rollout status deployment/scg
kubectl -n spark-connect get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=scg
kubectl -n spark-connect port-forward svc/scg 9090:9090 &
curl http://localhost:9090/readyz   # expect: 200 ready
curl http://localhost:9090/healthz  # expect: 200 ok
```

If `/readyz` returns 503, the backend pool is empty. See the
[runbook](runbook.md#readyz-stuck-on-503).

## Picking the backend discovery mode

The gateway needs a list of Spark Connect server addresses. Two
ways:

### `static` — explicit list

```yaml
backendDiscovery:
  type: static
  static:
    addresses:
      - "spark-connect-1.svc.cluster.local:15002"
      - "spark-connect-2.svc.cluster.local:15002"
```

Use this when:

* Spark Connect servers run *outside* this Kubernetes cluster (VMs,
  another cluster, an EMR-managed driver).
* You're scripting the address list from outside Helm anyway (CI
  produces it).
* You want zero RBAC on the gateway pod.

### `k8s` — Endpoints watch

```yaml
backendDiscovery:
  type: k8s
  k8s:
    namespace: spark-connect
    serviceName: spark-connect
    port: 15002
```

Use this when Spark Connect servers run as pods in *this* cluster
and you scale them up/down — the gateway picks up additions and
removals within seconds without a Helm rollout. This is the natural
match for the
[`apache/spark-kubernetes-operator`](https://github.com/apache/spark-kubernetes-operator)
deployment pattern (see
[`deploy/examples/spark-connect-server/`](../deploy/examples/spark-connect-server/)
in this repo).

The chart automatically attaches a `Role` and `RoleBinding` granting
`endpoints/endpointslices` get/list/watch in the target namespace
when `type: k8s`. If your namespaced backend lives in a *different*
namespace from the gateway release, the chart puts the Role in the
backend namespace and the RoleBinding pointing at the gateway's
ServiceAccount in the release namespace.

## Picking the Redis backing

The gateway maps `(user_id, session_id) -> backend` and pins each
session to that backend forever. Where that map lives is the most
important production decision.

### `affinityStore.type: memory` — single-replica only

`HashMap` in the gateway process. Simple, fast, lost on pod
restart. **Only safe with `replicaCount: 1`** — multiple replicas
each have their own map, and a load balancer that fans out across
replicas will repeatedly re-pin sessions to different backends,
breaking Spark Connect's per-driver `SparkSession` invariant
(temp views, cached frames, conf settings disappear).

The chart enforces this at template time: `replicaCount > 1` with
`affinityStore.type: memory` causes `helm install` to fail.

Use case: dev / PoC / single-tenant on a single-pod box. Not for
HA.

### `affinityStore.type: redis` — recommended

The default. The map lives in Redis; all replicas read/write the
same dataset.

Two flavors:

**Bundled** (`redis.enabled: true`, default):

```yaml
redis:
  enabled: true
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    size: 1Gi
```

A single-replica StatefulSet with AOF persistence. Good for dev,
staging, and small-scale production. The dataset is tiny (one entry
per active Spark session, a few hundred bytes), 1Gi is over-sized
for any realistic workload.

Limitations:

* Single replica — Redis itself is a SPOF. Restart drops in-flight
  reads briefly; AOF means the dataset survives.
* No auth, no TLS — fine on a private namespace, not for shared
  clusters.

**External managed Redis** (`redis.enabled: false`):

```yaml
redis:
  enabled: false
affinityStore:
  type: redis
  redis:
    url: rediss://elasticache.aws.example:6379
    keyPrefix: scg-prod
    sessionTtlSecs: 3600
    opTtlSecs: 900
```

Use this for any production deployment that takes uptime seriously
— ElastiCache, Cloud Memorystore, Bitnami Redis Helm chart with
Sentinel, etc. The gateway only requires basic single-node
semantics; no Redis Cluster features are used.

What URL format is supported:

* `redis://host:port`
* `redis://:password@host:port`
* `redis://:password@host:port/<db-index>`
* `rediss://host:port` (TLS)

### What happens when Redis is unreachable

The gateway logs a `warn!` per failed Redis call and **degrades
gracefully** — lookups return `None`, binds quietly drop. The
visible effect is that session stickiness stops working; sessions
land on whatever the pool picks each time, the same behaviour you'd
see with the in-memory store on a single replica.

Service stays up; HA stickiness recovers as soon as Redis does.
This is a deliberate design choice — failing requests because
Redis is slow would be worse than a brief stickiness gap.

## Picking the auth mode

| `auth.type` | When to use |
|---|---|
| `none` | Trusted in-cluster network only. Every caller is `user_id="anonymous"`. The gateway's own metrics are usable but you cannot tell tenants apart. |
| `static` | Dev / single-team. Bearer tokens listed in `values.yaml`. Tokens are sealed-secret-able but rotation requires `helm upgrade`. |
| `jwt` | You already issue your own JWTs and have the verification key handy (PEM file or HMAC secret). Audience + issuer claims are checked. |
| `oidc` | Production with an external IdP (Okta, Auth0, Google, Keycloak). The gateway fetches JWKS from `discovery_url`, caches keys, refreshes on `kid` miss with a configurable floor. |

For all four, the gateway *replaces* the client-supplied
`UserContext.user_id` on the forwarded request with the verified
identity, so a malicious client cannot impersonate another user just
by lying in `UserContext`.

Production rule of thumb: `oidc` if you have an IdP, `jwt` if you're
issuing JWTs in-house, `static` for a closed dev setup, `none` only
for namespace-isolated clusters.

## Multi-tenant: picking a tenant resolver (Phase 3)

> **Looking for a one-page multi-tenant setup walkthrough?** See
> [`multitenancy.md`](multitenancy.md) for the decision matrix,
> three complete sample configs, and migration paths. The sections
> below are the deep reference for each individual knob.

The routing key the gateway uses for session affinity is now
`(tenant, user_id, session_id)`. The tenant prefix lets two
tenants share a gateway without their `session_id` namespaces
colliding — `(team-a, alice, sess-1)` is a different key from
`(team-b, alice, sess-1)`.

The `tenantResolver` config block tells the gateway *how* to figure
out which tenant each RPC belongs to. Pick by deployment shape:

| Deployment shape | `source` | `onMissing` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1/2 upgrading to Phase 3 code**, single-tenant | `from_claim` | `use_default` | The default. Tenant comes from the auth claim if there is one, otherwise falls back to `"default"`. Nothing changes operationally — every RPC ends up in `tenant="default"`. |
| **JWT/OIDC multi-tenant** with a `tenant` claim | `from_claim` | `reject` | Tenant from JWT. Reject any RPC whose verified identity has no tenant claim — that's almost always an IdP misconfiguration in SaaS-style deployments. |
| **No auth but client cooperates** via metadata | `from_metadata` | `use_default` or `reject` | Tenant from a gRPC metadata header (default `x-tenant`). Use `reject` if every client *must* send the header; `use_default` is appropriate when missing-header clients are legitimate internal tools that should land in a default pool. |
| **Single-tenant deployment running Phase 3 code** | `always_default` | n/a | Ignore claim and header; every RPC goes to `defaultName`. Use this when you want Phase 3 code but no multi-tenant routing. |

The chart's default values are the first row above, so a fresh
install retains Phase 1/2 single-tenant behaviour with zero
config changes.

**Migration note**: when you switch a running deployment from
`use_default` to `reject`, any client whose token doesn't carry a
tenant claim starts getting `Unauthenticated`. Roll the auth-side
change (issue tokens with tenant claims) before flipping
`onMissing` to `reject`. Watch
`scg_rpcs_total{code="Unauthenticated"}` during the change.

## Per-tenant pools (Phase 3.2)

Building on the tenant resolver above: each tenant can route to a
*different* backend pool. A SaaS deployment isolates team-A's
queries from team-B's by giving them different Spark Connect
clusters; a per-team deployment shares one cluster.

The `backendDiscovery:` setting at the top of `values.yaml` is the
*default* pool. Add per-tenant overrides under `tenantPools`:

```yaml
backendDiscovery:
  type: static
  static:
    addresses:
      - "spark-shared-1.svc.cluster.local:15002"
      - "spark-shared-2.svc.cluster.local:15002"

tenantPools:
  onUnknownTenant: reject   # strict: only configured tenants
  overrides:
    team-a:
      type: static
      addresses:
        - "spark-team-a-1.svc.cluster.local:15002"
        - "spark-team-a-2.svc.cluster.local:15002"
    team-b:
      type: k8s
      namespace: spark-team-b
      serviceName: spark-connect
      port: 15002
```

`onUnknownTenant` is the routing equivalent of the resolver's
`onMissing` policy:

| Setting | Behaviour for a tenant not in `overrides` |
|---|---|
| `use_default` (default) | Route through the default pool. Back-compat with Phase 1/2 — every tenant shares the same backends. |
| `reject` | `PermissionDenied` to the client. Use for strict SaaS-style isolation; pairs naturally with `tenantResolver.onMissing=reject`. |

Each per-tenant pool gets the same active health-check treatment
as the default pool (when `healthCheck.enabled: true`) — health
probing runs independently per pool, so an unhealthy
team-a backend doesn't affect team-b routing.

**What back-compat looks like**: leaving `tenantPools.overrides`
empty (the default) means every tenant — including the `default`
tenant from the resolver — routes through the deployment's single
pool. This is identical to Phase 1/2 behaviour. You opt into
multi-tenant routing by listing tenants you want isolated.

## Per-tenant rate limiting (Phases 3.6 / 3.7)

When a single tenant can monopolize the shared backends — bursts
of session creation, runaway PySpark notebooks, malicious
clients — rate limiting protects the rest. The gateway implements
a token bucket per tenant (and optionally per user inside the
tenant); every RPC takes a token, RPCs that find an empty bucket
fail with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`.

**Two store backends:**

* `rateLimit.store: memory` (default) — bucket state in each
  gateway replica. Simple, no extra infra, but the effective
  cluster-wide quota is `N × rpcsPerSecond` for N replicas.
* `rateLimit.store: redis` — atomic token bucket in Redis via a
  Lua script, shared across all replicas. Cluster-wide enforcement
  matches the configured rate exactly. See
  [`multitenancy.md`](multitenancy.md#distributed-rate-limiting-phase-37)
  for fail-mode semantics (`onFailure: open | closed`) and the
  `scg_rate_limit_redis_errors_total` metric.

Off by default. Turn on with:

```yaml
rateLimit:
  enabled: true
  default:
    rpcsPerSecond: 100   # default tenant refill rate
    burst: 200           # max consecutive RPCs before throttling
  overrides:
    team-a:
      rpcsPerSecond: 500
      burst: 1000
    enterprise-tenant:
      rpcsPerSecond: 2000
      burst: 5000
      perUserRpcsPerSecond: 200   # tighter per-user cap inside the tenant
      perUserBurst: 400
```

The per-user dimension is opt-in. Leave `perUserRpcsPerSecond: 0`
(the default) to skip it; only the per-tenant bucket applies. Turn
it on when one tenant has many users and you want to keep any
single user from using the tenant's entire quota.

Tuning starting points:

| Workload shape | Default RPS | Burst |
|---|---|---|
| Many short Spark queries per session | 200 | 400 |
| Long ExecutePlan streams, infrequent setup RPCs | 30 | 60 |
| Mixed / unknown | 100 | 200 |

Reading `scg_rate_limit_rejected_total{tenant, scope}` tells you
whether the limits are biting and which scope (`tenant` vs `user`)
is the bottleneck. See [`observability.md`](observability.md) for
PromQL examples.

## Audit logging (Phase 3.8)

The gateway always knows *what* happened (metrics) and *how it
happened* (logs/traces). Audit logging adds a third stream tuned for
*who did what, when* — the events compliance and security teams ask
for. Configure under `audit:` in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
audit:
  enabled: true              # default
  logSuccessfulRpcs: false   # default; turn on only under strict policy
```

Default events (`session.create`, `session.release`, `auth.failure`,
`rpc.error`) are emitted as JSON log lines with
`"target": "scg::audit"` — operators filter on that target in
Loki/Splunk to materialise an audit stream distinct from operational
logs. See [`observability.md`](observability.md#audit-logging) for the
event schema, sample queries, and the rationale for reusing the log
pipeline instead of adding a separate sink.

When to flip `logSuccessfulRpcs: true`:

* The deployment falls under a policy that requires per-call records
  (regulated industries, SOC 2 type-II audits scoped to data access).
* You have a log-retention budget that can absorb one extra event per
  successful RPC — the audit stream then scales with request rate.

When to leave it off (most deployments): metric counts on
`scg_rpcs_total{code="OK"}` already provide aggregate success, and
filling the audit stream with every Config call dilutes the signal
the four default events are meant to provide.

Disable the whole stream (`audit.enabled: false`) only in dev/local
environments — the per-event cost is one structured log line and
there is rarely a good reason to keep it off in production.

## Active backend health checks

By default the gateway routes to whatever its pool reports as
healthy: a static-pool member is always assumed up; a K8s
service-watch pool reflects the EndpointSlice. Neither catches a
backend that is *running* but *wedged* — the pod responds to TCP
but its gRPC server is stuck. Active probing closes that gap.

Turn it on:

```yaml
healthCheck:
  enabled: true
  intervalSecs: 5            # probe every 5s
  timeoutSecs: 2             # 2s deadline per probe
  unhealthyThreshold: 3      # 3 consecutive failures → evict
  healthyThreshold: 2        # 2 consecutive successes → re-admit
```

Each backend is probed via `grpc.health.v1.Health/Check` (the
[standard protocol](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md)).
A backend that doesn't ship the Health service responds with
`UNIMPLEMENTED`/`NOT_FOUND`; the gateway treats that as an
ambiguous signal and keeps the backend in rotation, since older
Spark Connect server builds don't register Health by default.

Defaults (5s × 3 = ~15s eviction window) are biased towards "don't
evict on a momentary glitch" rather than "evict instantly." Tighten
if your traffic is sensitive to a stuck-pod tail.

## Graceful shutdown

When the gateway pod gets SIGTERM (Helm rolling upgrade, K8s pod
eviction, scale-down), it does a two-phase drain:

1. **Phase 1 — readiness flips off.** `/readyz` starts returning
   503; the K8s Service controller removes the pod from its
   Endpoints within ~5s. New client traffic stops landing.
2. **Phase 2 — wait for in-flight streams.** The gateway polls
   `scg_active_streams`. As long as ExecutePlan / ReattachExecute
   / AddArtifacts streams are still flowing, the gRPC server stays
   up. When `active_streams == 0` *or* `shutdown.deadlineSecs`
   elapses, the gRPC + admin servers shut down.

Configure the deadline:

```yaml
shutdown:
  deadlineSecs: 30
```

The chart's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` is automatically set to
`deadlineSecs + 10` so K8s gives the gateway enough wall-clock to
finish draining before SIGKILL hits. **If you change one without the
other**, the smaller value wins:

* `deadlineSecs` smaller → drain force-quits early; in-flight
  streams seen as `Cancelled` by clients.
* `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` smaller → K8s SIGKILLs mid-drain;
  same client-side effect, plus `shutdown complete` log line never
  appears.

For long-running ExecutePlan workloads, raise both. The chart's
30s default is enough for the gRPC handshake teardown, but a
multi-minute Spark query in flight will be cut.

## Day 1: hardening

The defaults give you function; production needs all of:

1. **Switch off `auth.type: none`.** External traffic to a
   gateway running with `none` is a "we trust the network" bet that
   ages badly.
2. **Use external Redis.** The bundled Redis is a SPOF. Pointing at
   ElastiCache / Memorystore costs little and removes the SPOF.
3. **Set resource requests/limits.** The chart defaults
   (100m CPU / 128Mi RAM) are reasonable for low traffic; size up
   to your real load.
4. **Turn on tracing if you have a collector.** The gateway exports
   OTLP/gRPC; logs already include the same correlation ID, but
   spans on a UI like Tempo or Jaeger make multi-hop investigations
   fast. See [`tracing.md`](observability.md#distributed-tracing)
   for the known limitation around inbound `traceparent`.
5. **Pin the image tag.** `image.tag: ""` resolves to the chart's
   `appVersion`. For production, set it to a specific digest:
   ```yaml
   image:
     repository: ghcr.io/<your-mirror>/spark-connect-gateway
     tag: "0.1.0@sha256:abc123..."
   ```
6. **Wire probes to your platform.** The chart already configures
   `/healthz` and `/readyz` on the admin port; if your platform
   does extra synthetic checks, point them at `/readyz` rather than
   the gRPC port (the gRPC port has no HTTP health endpoint, by
   gRPC convention).

## Day 2: upgrades

`helm upgrade` re-renders templates and rolls the Deployment. Two
things that catch operators:

### ConfigMap changes don't always trigger pod rolls — but the chart
makes them.

The Deployment template includes a `checksum/config` annotation
that hashes the rendered ConfigMap. Any value change → annotation
change → pod template change → rolling restart. You should *not*
need to manually `kubectl rollout restart`.

### Redis affinity state survives rolling upgrades.

Because affinity lives in Redis (or the in-memory store, which
dies with the pod anyway), a `helm upgrade` rolling restart does
*not* reshuffle existing sessions — they stay pinned to their
original backends. The
[`session_ttl_secs`](https://github.com/.../scg-store-redis/src/lib.rs)
is refreshed on every read, so active sessions don't expire during
the rollout window.

Sessions that haven't been touched for `session_ttl_secs` *will*
expire and be re-picked on next access; tune this if your client
idle pattern is unusual.

### Rollback

`helm rollback scg <revision>` works as expected. The Redis
StatefulSet's PVC is **not** deleted on uninstall (intentional —
see below), so a rollback that brings back an older Helm release
finds its data.

If a config change broke things, prefer `helm rollback` over
`kubectl edit` of the Deployment — the latter doesn't roll the
ConfigMap back in lockstep.

## Uninstall

```bash
helm uninstall scg -n spark-connect
```

This removes the Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, ServiceAccount,
RBAC, and the Redis StatefulSet itself — but **leaves the Redis
PVC behind**. This is intentional: a re-install picks up where the
old one left off, and unwanted PVCs are easy to spot in
`kubectl get pvc`.

To wipe Redis state explicitly:

```bash
kubectl -n spark-connect delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/component=redis
```

If you used external Redis (`redis.enabled: false`), the data
isn't ours to clean up — flush the prefix yourself:

```bash
redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" --scan --pattern "scg:*" | xargs redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" del
```

## Validation: end-to-end test against your cluster

The repo ships [`crates/proxy/examples/ha_smoke.rs`](../crates/proxy/examples/ha_smoke.rs)
which validates the three multi-replica HA invariants (shared
state, failover after replica death, op-id reverse index across
replicas) against any reachable Redis. To run it against your
deployed cluster:

```bash
kubectl -n spark-connect port-forward svc/scg-redis 6399:6379 &
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6399 cargo run -p scg-proxy --example ha_smoke
```

This spins up *its own* in-process gateway pair against your
deployed Redis, which proves the Redis is well-configured and the
chart's value mapping is correct. It does not exercise the
deployed *gateway pods* themselves; for that, see
[`observability.md`](observability.md) for what to watch in
metrics during a soak test.
